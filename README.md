# 42-CPP_MODULES

Welcome to **CPP_MODULES**, a collection of exercises that aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the C++ programming language.
The exercises in this repository provided me a hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of various C++ concepts.

## Concepts Learned

Here are the key concepts addressed and practiced throughout the modules:

1. **Classes**: Explore the concept of classes, which allows you to define custom data types with associated member functions and variables.

2. **Non-member Functions**: Understand how to define functions that are not members of any class and learn when to use them effectively.

3. **Filestream**: Learn how to work with file streams to perform input and output operations on files.

4. **Function Overload**: Discover the technique of function overloading, which enables you to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.

5. **Operator Overload**: Explore the concept of operator overloading, allowing you to redefine the behavior of operators for your custom classes.

6. **Canonical Form**: Learn about the canonical form, which is a set of predefined member functions that ensure proper initialization, copying, and destruction of objects.

7. **Sub-typing Polymorphism**: Understand the concept of sub-typing polymorphism using virtual functions, allowing derived classes to be treated as base classes.

8. **Abstract Classes**: Discover abstract classes, which cannot be instantiated and are meant to serve as base classes for other classes.

9. **Exceptions**: Learn how to handle exceptions, which are used to manage unexpected situations that occur during program execution.

10. **Cast**: Understand various casting techniques such as static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, and const_cast, and learn when to use them appropriately.

11. **Attributes and Functions**: Explore the concept of attributes and functions, which are essential building blocks for defining classes and working with objects.

12. **Templates**: Discover the power of templates, allowing you to write generic code that can be used with different data types.

13. **STL (Standard Template Library)**: Learn about the rich set of containers, algorithms, and iterators provided by the STL, enabling efficient and flexible programming.

14. **`this` Pointer**: Understand the 'this' pointer, which refers to the current object within a member function, allowing you to access its member variables and functions.

15. **List Initialization**: Explore list initialization, a concise and versatile way of initializing variables and objects.

16. **Const**: Learn how to use the `const` keyword to specify that variables, member functions, or function parameters are read-only.

17. **Private**: Understand the concept of private access specifier, which restricts access to class members from outside the class.

18. **Accessors**: Learn about accessors, also known as getter and setter functions, which provide controlled access to private member variables.

19. **Comparison**: Discover various techniques for comparing objects, such as overloading the comparison operators or providing custom comparison functions.

20. **Pointers**: Understand the fundamentals of pointers, a powerful tool in C++, allowing you to manipulate memory addresses and work with dynamic memory allocation.

## Getting Started
To get started with CPP_MODULES, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimiOui/CPP_MODULES.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd CPP_MODULES
```

Each module is organized in a separate folder. Inside each module folder, you will find the corresponding source code files for each exercice.
